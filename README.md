**Risk-Averse Dynamic Programming via Semismooth Newton Methods**
This repository provides a Python implementation of novel semismooth Newton algorithms to solve **risk-averse Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** under Markovian risk measures‚Äîparticularly the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) and Mean-Upper-Semideviation of order 1 (MUS1).

## ‚≠ê Features

* Implements **three semismooth Newton methods** for risk-averse MDPs:

  1. **SNM‚ÄØI**: Sequential risk-neutral MDP solves with perturbed transitions.
  2. **SNM‚ÄØII**: A risk-averse policy-iteration‚Äìstyle Newton solve.
  3. **SNM‚ÄØIII**: A linearized, piecewise-smooth Newton update.
* Includes **risk-averse optimistic policy iteration** as a comparative baseline.
* Supports **CVaR** and **MUS1** as risk measures, with theoretical guarantees of quadratic convergence under certain conditions.
* Benchmarked on synthetic MDPs with varied sizes and discount factors, with empirical performance data included.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and install the package:

1. **Create and activate a Conda environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create -n riskaverse python=3.10
   conda activate riskaverse
   ```

2. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install the package in editable mode**:

   ```bash
   pip install -e . --use-pep517
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:

   ```bash
   python -c "from riskaverse_DP.mdps import mdp; print('Success')"
   ```

This will ensure your `riskaverse_DP` package is installed and ready for development.

## üì¶ Usage

Basic usage pattern:

```python
import numpy as np
from riskaverse_DP.mdps import mdp

n_states = 10
n_actions = 3

# Initialize with transition and stage-cost data
my_mdp = mdp(n_states, n_actions)

gamma_ = 0.9
alpha_ = 0.1
v_0 = np.zeros(n_states, )

from riskaverse_DP.CVaR_solvers import SNMI

my_SNMI = SNMI(gamma_, alpha_)

# Solve using one of the methods: "SNMI", "SNMII", "SNMIII", or "OPI"
v_opt, res = my_SNMI.solve(my_mdp, v_0)
```

Check the `examples/` folder for detailed scripts on synthetic MDPs.

## üìà Benchmark Results

Experiments on MDPs with sizes up to 100 states and diversified action spaces show:

* **SNM methods** reach convergence in fewer than 10 iterations, whereas risk-averse VI needs over 150.
* **CPU times**: SNM‚ÄØI and SNM‚ÄØIII are most efficient; SNM‚ÄØII may face numeric issues depending on solver accuracy.

### Mean-Upper-Semideviation (Order 1)

This project implements the **Mean-Upper-Semideviation risk measure of order 1 (MUS1)**, a coherent risk measure used in risk-averse optimization and decision-making.

Given a random variable `X` and a parameter `kappa` in `[0, 1]`, the MUS1 risk measure is defined as:

    rho(X) = E[X] + kappa * E[(X - E[X])_+]

Here, `(x)_+` denotes the positive part of `x`, i.e., `max(x, 0)`. The parameter `kappa` controls the degree of risk sensitivity to values above the mean.

For a finite probability space with outcomes `X_i` and probabilities `p_i`, the MUS1 risk measure has the following dual representation as a **linear program (LP)**:

**Linear Program:**

    Maximize:     sum_i p_i * xi_i * X_i

    Subject to:   sum_i p_i * xi_i = 1
                  0 <= xi_i <= 1 + kappa   for all i

This LP computes the worst-case expected value under a distorted probability distribution defined by the weights `xi_i * p_i`, consistent with the MUS1 risk measure.
